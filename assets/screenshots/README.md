# ModelDuck screenshot gallery

Twenty-seven stills for the ModelDuck video, captured from the real control panel at 1440×900 and 390×844. `23-social-preview.png` is the 1280×640 social card.

The demo states are injected by `scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`; they are illustrative examples, not benchmark claims. Regenerate the full set with:

```bash
npm run ui:shots
```
